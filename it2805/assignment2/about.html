      <li>The server hosts files and serves the client via some program which the client can send requests to.</li>
      <li>The client communicates with the server and can request certain info such as a webpage.
        When it is received it will render it locally.</li>

        Think telephone number for network devices.</li>
      <li>DNS allows us to resolve domain names such as vg.no to the correct IP address so we do not have to remember and need to be locked to static IP addresses.
        Think telephone address book for devices.</li>
